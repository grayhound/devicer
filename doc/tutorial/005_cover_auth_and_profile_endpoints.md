# Cover `auth` and `profile` endpoints and learn test sequencer

We know how to make jest not to run tests in parallel.

But we have additional endpoints now that work on the same database.

What's the point of testing `login` or `profile` endpoints if there are no users in the database?

We want to run `signup` tests first, then we want `login` tests and only then `profile` tests.

`Jest` doesn't give it to us just out of the box.

Fortunately, there are couple of ways to solve the problem.

One of them is using `@jest/test-sequencer`.

Another one - is to export every test as a function and then run them in order we need. 

Lets make some preparations!

## Refactoring tests

Rename all  `test/signup/*` files.

They were called `delete.e2e-spec.ts`, `get.e2e-spec.ts`, etc.

Rebane them to look like:
- `delete.test.ts`
- `get.test.ts`
- `patch.test.ts`
- `post.test.ts`
- `put.test.ts`

Now, we need to export those tests as functions.

All you just have to do is wrap tests with methods.

For example, `delete.test.ts` will look like this:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';

export const SignupDeleteTest = () => {
  describe('[DELETE] /signup endpoint', () => {
    it('must return 404 on get request', async () => {
      const res = await request(global.app.getHttpServer())
        .delete(`${global.prefix}/signup`)
        .send();
      expect(res.status).toBe(404);
      expect(res.body.statusCode).toBe(404);
    });
  });
};
```

The same goes for other test files:

`get.test.ts`:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';

export const SignupGetTest = () => {
  describe('[GET] /signup endpoint', () => {
    it('must return 404 on get request', async () => {
      const res = await request(global.app.getHttpServer())
        .get(`${global.prefix}/signup`)
        .send();
      expect(res.status).toBe(404);
      expect(res.body.statusCode).toBe(404);
    });
  });
};
```

`patch.test.ts`:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';

export const SignupPatchTest = () => {
  describe('[PATCH] /signup endpoint', () => {
    it('must return 404 on get request', async () => {
      const res = await request(global.app.getHttpServer())
        .patch(`${global.prefix}/signup`)
        .send();
      expect(res.status).toBe(404);
      expect(res.body.statusCode).toBe(404);
    });
  });
};
```

`post.test.ts`:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';

export const SignupPostTest = () => {
  ...
};

```

`put.test.ts`:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';

export const SignupPutTest = () => {
  describe('[PUT] /signup endpoint', () => {
    it('must return 404 on get request', async () => {
      const res = await request(global.app.getHttpServer())
        .put(`${global.prefix}/signup`)
        .send();
      expect(res.status).toBe(404);
      expect(res.body.statusCode).toBe(404);
    });
  });
}
```

Right now those tests won't run 'cause we changed their names.

Now, we should create `src/tests/singup/signup.test.ts`:

```typescript
import { SignupDeleteTest } from './delete.test';
import { SignupGetTest } from './get.test';
import { SignupPatchTest } from './patch.test';
import { SignupPutTest } from './put.test';
import { SignupPostTest } from './post.test';

export const SignupTests = {
  delete: SignupDeleteTest,
  get: SignupGetTest,
  patch: SignupPatchTest,
  put: SignupPutTest,
  post: SignupPostTest,
};
```

And the last one - edit `app.e2e.spec.ts`:

```typescript
import * as request from 'supertest';
import { SignupTests } from './signup/signup.tests';

describe('Tests', () => {
  it('/ (GET)', () => {
    return request(global.app.getHttpServer())
      .get(`${global.prefix}`)
      .expect(200)
      .expect('Hello World!');
  });
});

describe('SignupTests', () => {
  describe('SignupGetTest', SignupTests.get);
  describe('SignupPostTest', SignupTests.post);
  describe('SignupDeleteTest', SignupTests.delete);
  describe('SignupPatchTest', SignupTests.patch);
  describe('SignupPutTest', SignupTests.put);
});
```

Easy as pie! We just import those tests from `SignupTests`, create new `describe` block and inside it - another describes that use our imported tests.

And you can easily change tests order or create different test blocks for different endpoints.

Go ahead! Run the tests!

`npm run test:e2e`

âˆš 21 tests passed!
